# save-to-subreddit
Python script that takes links from you "saved" and posts them to a subreddit of your choice. Preferably a personal one.

## Dependencies
The script requires `python3` and [`praw`](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html):

```
pip install praw
```

For the script to know your authentication details you need to create a `praw.ini` file, see [here](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/configuration/prawini.html).
